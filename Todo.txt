To Check : 
==============================
If the maze works if there is a checkpoint at start or end


Bugs to Fix :
=============================
Does Not work for complex mazes like mazes which have loops in between.

TODO for Maze Solver project :
==============================
1. Method to Detect if the maze has flaws(cell conflicts)
2. Make it possible to change start and end positions of the loop 
3. Make it take input from text file instead of changing data in the main program.


Solving Algorithm:
===============================
2. Find Shortest path out of all the possiblities
