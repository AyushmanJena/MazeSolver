ISSUES WHILE MOVING UP IN the maze
Checkpoint where the pointer is supposed to move u

If (checkpoint)
tempStr = maze.i.j
checkpointWalls(tempStr, lastMove)
same old for loop

checkPointWalls : Takes in maze.i.j in str and considering lastmove blocks walls all the walls visited in the old loop and converts 1 into 0 


Method to detect if the maze data has flaws (cell conflicts)
Cleanup code 

Update readme
==============================


Bugs to Fix :
==============================
Not working for larger mazes 


Write a whole new code for move() with better algorithm



TODO for Maze Solver project :
==============================
5. Make it take input from text file instead of changing data in the main program.


Solving Algorithm:
===============================
1. Write the solving algorithm
2. Follow one wall algorithm
2. Find Shortest path out of all the possiblities


add checkPoint to the cell then try first route, if deadEnd reached go back to checkPoint and go in the second route
